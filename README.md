GeoData Algorithms for Spatial Problems (GASP)
====================

The GeoData Algorithms for Spatial Problems (GASP) is a free and open source library for geospatial data science.
It consistes of a set of Python Methods to support the automatization of spatial analysis activities based on Geographic Information Systems Software inside any application. These Python Methods could be included in any high-level application for spatial analysis.

GASP Components
====================

### Spatial Analysis algorithms or procedures ###

##### Methods and Algorithms for Land Use/ Land Cover mapping #####

- **OSM2LULC** - implementation in Python of an algorithm for the conversion of OpenStreetMap data into Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps. [Know more about OSM2LULC!](/gasp3/alg/osm2lulc/)

### Implementation of GIS Software tools ###

- **TODO**

### Data interoperability and data extraction tools ###

- **TODO**

### Tools for Web Frameworks ###

- **TODO**
